Assignment Questions

Q1. What is Statistics?
Ans: - Statistics is the science concerned with developing and studying methods for collecting, analyzing, interpreting and presenting empirical data. Statistics is a method of interpreting, analyzing and summarizing the data.

Q2. Define the different types of statistics and give an example of when each type might be used.
Ans: - There are two types of statistics which are descriptive Statistics and inferential Statistics.
1. Descriptive Statistics
The Data is described in a summarized way. The summarization is done from the sample of the population using different parameters like Mean or standard deviation. Descriptive Statistics are a way of using charts, graphs, and summary measures to organize, represent, and explain a set of Data. 
Data is typically arranged and displayed in tables or graphs summarizing details such as histograms, pie charts, bars or scatter plots.
1. Measures of Central tendency (Mean, Medium, mode)
2. Measures of Dispersion (Range, interquartile range, and standard deviation)
Example: - When analyzing numbers regarding the prior Major League Baseball season, descriptive statistics including 
The highest batting average for a single player,
The number of runs allowed per team, and the average wins per division.
2. Inferential Statistics
In the Inferential Statistics, we try to interpret the Meaning of descriptive Statistics. After the Data has been collected, analyzed, and summarized we use Inferential Statistics to describe the Meaning of the collected Data. 
Inferential Statistics use the probability principle to assess whether trends contained in the research sample can be generalized to the larger population from which the sample originally comes. Inferential Statistics are intended to test hypotheses and investigate relationships between variables and can be used to make population predictions.
Inferential Statistics are used to draw conclusions and inferences, i.e., to make valid generalizations from samples.
Example: - A biologist studies a population of animals and uses inferential statistics to estimate the size of the entire population based on a sample.

Q3.What are the different types of data and how do they differ from each other? Provide an example of each type of data.
Ans: - Data means to a systematic record of a specific quantity. It is the diverse values of that quantity together which the sets represent. In other words, it is a set of facts and figures which are useful in a particular purpose like a survey or an analysis.
Qualitative data refers to information that is descriptive and non-numerical in nature, while quantitative data refers to information that is numerical and can be measured or counted. 
(I) Qualitative data (ordinal) - This type of data is qualitative but has a specific order or ranking. And this type of data is also categorical, but can be ordered or ranked. Such as a rating scale from 1 to 5.
Example: - The ranking of a sports team in a league (1st, 2nd, 3rd).
(ii) Qualitative data (nominal) - This type of data is qualitative and does not have any specific order or ranking and this type of data is categorical and cannot be ordered or ranked such as gender or color.
Example: - The colors of a traffic light (red, yellow, and green).

(iii) Quantitative data (continuous) - This type of data is quantitative and can take on any value within a certain range and this type of data is also numerical and has equal intervals between values, but there is a true zero point. Such as height or weight.
Example: - The weight of a person in kilograms (60 kg).

(iv) Quantitative data (discrete) - This type of data is quantitative and can only take on specific values, this type of data is numerical and the intervals between the values are equal. However, there is no true zero point such as the number of siblings someone has.
Example: - The temperature in Celsius on a given day (20°C).

Q4.Categorise the following datasets with respect to quantitative and qualitative data types:
(I) grading in exam: A+, A, B+, B, C+, C, D, E
(ii) Color of mangoes: yellow, green, orange, red
(iii) Height data of a class: [178.9, 179, 179.5, 176, 177.2, 178.3, 175.8,]
(iv) Number of mangoes exported by a farm: [500, 600, 478, 672,]

Ans: - Qualitative data refers to information that is descriptive and non-numerical in nature, while quantitative data refers to information that is numerical and can be measured or counted. 
(i) Grading in exam: A+, A, B+, B, C+, C, D, E
Ans: - Qualitative data (ordinal) 
(ii) Color of mangoes: yellow, green, orange, red
Ans: - Qualitative data (nominal) - This type of data is qualitative and does not have any specific order or ranking, such as gender or color.
(iii) Height data of a class: [178.9, 179, 179.5, 176, 177.2, 178.3, 175.8...]
Ans:-  Quantitative data (continuous) - This type of data is quantitative and can take on any value within a certain range, such as height or weight.
(iv) Number of mangoes exported by a farm: [500, 600, 478, 672, ...]
Ans:-  Quantitative data (discrete) - This type of data is quantitative and can only take on specific values, such as the number of siblings someone has.

Q5. Explain the concept of levels of measurement and give an example of a variable for each level.
Ans: - The levels of measurement refer to the different ways in which variables can be measured or classified. 
There are four levels of measurement: nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio.

(I) Nominal level - This level of measurement is used for variables that can be classified into categories with no inherent order or hierarchy. An example of a nominal variable is gender, where individuals can be classified as either male or female.

(ii) Ordinal level - This level of measurement is used for variables that can be ranked or ordered, but where the difference between each ranking is not necessarily equal. An example of an ordinal variable is education level, where individuals can be ranked in order of their level of education (e.g., high school, college, graduate school).

(iii) Interval level - This level of measurement is used for variables where the difference between each value is equal, but there is no true zero point. An example of an interval variable is temperature measured in Celsius or Fahrenheit.

(IV) Ratio level - This level of measurement is used for variables where the difference between each value is equal and there is a true zero point. An example of a ratio variable is weight, where a weight of zero indicates the absence of weight. 	
Q6. Why is it important to understand the level of measurement when analyzing data? Provide an Example to illustrate your answer.
Ans: - It is important to understand the level of measurement when analyzing data because it affects the type of statistical analysis that can be performed on the data. Different statistical tests are appropriate for different levels of measurement, and using the wrong test can lead to inaccurate results.
For example, if we have data on the number of siblings each person has (a nominal variable) and we want to compare the average number of siblings between two groups, we would use a chi-squared test. However, if we have data on the age of each person (an interval variable) and we want to compare the average age between two groups, we would use a t-test.
Understanding the level of measurement also helps us interpret the results of our analysis. For instance, if we find that the average age of one group is significantly higher than the other group, we know that this difference is meaningful because age is an interval variable with equal differences between values. 
Q7. How nominal data type is different from ordinal data type.
Ans: - Nominal data type and ordinal data type are two different levels of measurement in statistics. Nominal data is a categorical variable where the values are assigned to different categories or labels without any particular order or ranking. For example, the colors of a car (red, blue, green) or the types of fruits (apple, banana, orange) are nominal variables.
On the other hand, ordinal data is a categorical variable where the values have a specific order or ranking. However, the difference between the values is not necessarily equal. For example, the level of education (high school, associate degree, bachelor's degree, master's degree) or the rating of a movie (poor, fair, good, excellent) are ordinal variables.
The main difference between nominal and ordinal data is that nominal data only provides information about the categories or labels of a variable, whereas ordinal data provides information about both the categories and the order or ranking of the values. Additionally, while nominal data can only be analyzed using non-parametric tests, ordinal data can be analyzed using both non-parametric and parametric tests.

Q8. Which type of plot can be used to display data in terms of range?
Ans: - 
Histogram: - the groups depicted in a bar chart are actually continuous numeric ranges, we can push the bars together to generate a histogram. Bar lengths in histograms typically correspond to counts of data points, and their patterns demonstrate the distribution of variables in your data
Stacked Bar Chart: - One modification of the standard bar chart is to divide each bar into multiple smaller bars based on values of a second grouping variable, called a stacked bar chart. This allows you to not only compare primary group values like in a regular bar chart, but also illustrate a relative breakdown of each group’s whole into its constituent parts.
Grouped Bar Chart: - the sub-bars were placed side-by-side into clusters instead of kept in their stacks, we would obtain the grouped bar chart. The grouped bar chart does not allow for comparison of primary group totals, but does a much better job of allowing for comparison of the sub-groups.

Dot Plot: - dot plot is like a bar chart in that it indicates values for different categorical groupings, but encodes values based on a point’s position rather than a bar’s length. Dot plots are useful when you need to compare across categories, but the zero baseline is not informative or useful. You can also think of a dot plot as like a line plot with the line removed, so that it can be used with variables with unordered categories rather than just continuous or ordered variables.

Area Chart: - An area chart starts with the same foundation as a line chart – value points connected by line segments – but adds in a concept from the bar chart with shading between the line and a baseline. This chart is most often seen when combined with the concept of stacking, to show how both how a total has changed over time, but also how its components’ contributions have changed.
Dual Axis chart: - Dual-axis charts overlay two different charts with a shared horizontal axis, but potentially different vertical axis scales (one for each component chart). This can be useful to show a direct comparison between the two sets of vertical values, while also including the context of the horizontal-axis variable. It is common to use different base chart types, like the bar and line combination, to reduce confusion of the different axis scales for each component chart.
Bubble Chart: - the third variable is numeric in nature that is where the bubble chart comes in. A bubble chart builds on the base scatter plot by having the third variable’s value determine the size of each point. Another way of showing the relationship between three variables is through modification of a scatter plot. When a third variable is categorical, points can use different shapes or colors to indicate group membership. If the data points are ordered in some way, points can also be connected with line segments to show the sequence of values.
Density Curve: - The density curve, or kernel density estimate, is an alternative way of showing distributions of data instead of the histogram. Rather than collecting data points into frequency bins, each data point contributes a small volume of data whose collected whole becomes the density curve. While density curves may imply some data values that do not exist, they can be a good way to smooth out noise in the data to get an understanding of the distribution signal.
Violin Part: - An alternative to the box plot’s approach to comparing value distributions between groups is the violin plot. In a violin plot, each set of box and whiskers is replaced with a density curve built around a central baseline. This can provide a better comparison of data shapes between groups, though this does lose out on comparisons of precise statistical values. A frequent variation for violin plots is to include box-style markings on top of the violin plot to get the best of both worlds.
Heat Map: -The heat map presents a grid of values based on two variables of interest. The axis variables can be numeric or categorical; the grid is created by dividing each variable into ranges or levels like a histogram or bar chart. Grid cells are colored based on value, often with darker colors corresponding with higher values. A heat map can be an interesting alternative to a scatter plot when there are a lot of data points to plot, but the point density makes it difficult to see the true relationship between variables. 

Q9. Describe the difference between descriptive and inferential statistics. Give an example of each Type of statistics and explain how they are used.
Ans: - Descriptive and inferential statistics are two main branches of statistics that serve different purposes in data analysis.
Descriptive statistics involves methods of summarizing and presenting data in a meaningful way, without making any generalizations or inferences about the larger population. It describes the basic features of the data, such as the central tendency, variability, distribution, and shape. Descriptive statistics are used to gain an understanding of the characteristics of a dataset and to communicate this information to others.
Example: - descriptive statistics is calculating the mean, median, and mode of a dataset of exam scores to understand the typical performance of the students in the class.
In contrast, inferential statistics involves using a sample of data to make inferences or draw conclusions about the larger population from which the sample was drawn. It involves using statistical methods to test hypotheses and determine whether a result is statistically significant, or likely to be due to chance. Inferential statistics are used to make predictions, generalize findings, and support decision-making.
Example: - inferential statistics is conducting a hypothesis test to determine whether a new weight loss program is more effective than an existing program. A sample of individuals from each program is selected and their weight loss is measured. The data is analyzed using inferential statistics to determine whether the difference in weight loss between the two programs is statistically significant and not due to chance. The results can then be used to make an inference about the effectiveness of the new weight loss program for the larger population.

Q10. What are some common measures of central tendency and variability used in statistics? Explain how each measure can be used to describe a dataset?
Ans: - The central tendency measure is defined as the number used to represent the center or middle of a set of data values. The three commonly used measures of central tendency are the mean, median, and mode. A statistic that tells us how the data values are dispersed or spread out is called the measure of dispersion.
There are three commonly used measures of central tendency and several measures of variability used in statistics.

1. Measures of Central Tendency:
Mean: The mean is calculated by adding up all the data values and dividing by the total number of values. It is commonly used to represent the typical value or average of a dataset. The mean can be influenced by extreme values or outliers in the dataset, so it is not always the best measure of central tendency to use.
Median: The median is the middle value when the data values are arranged in order from smallest to largest (or largest to smallest). If there is an even number of data values, the median is the average of the two middle values. The median is not affected by extreme values or outliers, so it can be a more robust measure of central tendency compared to the mean.
Mode: The mode is the most frequently occurring value in the dataset. It is often used for nominal or categorical data, where there are no numeric values to calculate a mean or median.

2. Measures of Variability:
Range: The range is the difference between the largest and smallest values in the dataset. It gives an idea of how spread out the data is, but it is sensitive to extreme values or outliers.
Variance: The variance is the average of the squared differences between each data value and the mean. It measures how much the data values vary from the mean. A higher variance indicates that the data values are more spread out.
Standard Deviation: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It measures how much the data values deviate from the mean on average. The standard deviation is commonly used to describe the spread of a normal distribution.
